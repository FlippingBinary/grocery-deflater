# Middleware
This directory is for files associated with the middleware between the frontend and the backend. The middleware will be implemented in the form of a GraphQL Schema.

## GraphQL Playground

The GraphQL Playground allows users to interact with the data in a friendly environment which helps build a good query to obtain the necessary data. Variables are used for any value that will change during runtime (such as search queries). The results can be directly used by any front-end client.
